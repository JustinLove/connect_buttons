# Connect Buttons

Quick and dirty way to connect to hand-started local servers, and private servers.  There are three setting entires, I'll revaluate if that turns out to be too few.

The mod will check if you are currently assigned to a game on PlayFab, and provide a reconnect option if so.

The mod attempts to track when you connect to a game, and provides a means to reconnect to the last game.

## Titans

The static connect buttons use your global "Active Product" setting.

If you are running your own local or other server, the active expansion can only be cnfigured on server startup.  To access Titans content, include `--game-mode PAExpansion1:Config` in the command line
